# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.1] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed
- Added a 100ms hold in `restart_audio_engine` before client drop to guarantee Voicemeeter's message loop consumes `Command.Restart` before shared memory is unmapped during logout.
- Restored default USB settling delay to 150ms to allow USB audio class drivers to complete clock and format negotiation on hardware reconnects.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-18

### Performance
- Replaced `tasklist` subprocess execution with native Win32 `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot` and `Process32NextW` APIs, reducing process detection overhead from ~235ms to <0.3ms.
- Removed 50ms post-restart sleep in `restart_audio_engine`; parameter updates write directly to Voicemeeter shared memory.
- Reduced default USB settling delay from 150ms to 75ms.

### Security & Robustness
- Implemented XML entity escaping (`&`, `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`) and XPath literal sanitization in task generation to prevent injection and XML parse errors.
- Encapsulated FFI bindings in a `VoicemeeterClient` struct with a `Drop` implementation to ensure `VBVMR_Logout` and `FreeLibrary` are called on exit or error.
- Added dynamic DLL resolution via `%ProgramFiles(x86)%`, `%ProgramW6432%`, `%ProgramFiles%`, and `%SystemDrive%`.

### CLI & Diagnostics
- Added `--version` and `-v` flags.
- Added validation for numerical arguments (`--delay-ms`) and required parameters (`--device`).
- Added explicit error message when running `install` or `uninstall` without Administrator privileges.

### Tests
- Added automated unit tests for XML escaping, XPath sanitization, task generation, delay parsing, process detection, and DLL discovery.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-18

### Added
- Initial release.
- Event-driven trigger integrated with Windows Task Scheduler subscribing to `Microsoft-Windows-Audio/Operational` Event ID 65.
- Dynamic loading and IPC execution via `VoicemeeterRemote64.dll` (`Command.Restart = 1.0`).
- Configurable USB settling delay to allow USB audio driver format negotiation before restart.
- CLI commands: `restart`, `install`, `uninstall`, and `status`.
